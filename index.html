                Welcome! My name is Alyssa J Pupping. I have been an educator for over ten years 
            and recently began the transition to a career in tech. My skills in creating lesson plans 
            have been very useful in website design. I began dabbling in programming when I was just 
            twelve years old, but fell out of practice when I went to college. A lot has changed since 
            then, and I am excited to continue this journey! On a personal note, I recently moved back 
            home to California after living in Oregon for several years. I also spent a year living in 
            New York City, and a summer as a nanny in England. I have two cats (Jasmine and Jupiter) 
            and one dog (Bagby). I enjoy baking, painting, and solving puzzles.
