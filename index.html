                Welcome! My name is Alyssa J Pupping. I have been an educator for over ten years 
            and recently began the transition to a career in tech. My skills in creating lesson plans 
            have been very useful in website design. I began dabbling in coding when I was just 
            twelve years old, but fell out of practice when I went to college. A lot has changed since 
            then, and I am excited to continue this journey! <br><br>
            I live in Vista, California with my family, two cats, and one dog. I love baking, photography, and hiking in the forest.
